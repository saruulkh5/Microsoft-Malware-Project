4_sql

This project utilizes a Microsoft SQL Server that implements the data model designed the team. The database is thoroughly populated with the help of over 40 stored procedures and temp objects; the analysis scripts also utilized stored procedures and loops.

The finalized SQL Scripts contains **population** and **analysis** scripts and a `playground.sql` file in which misc operations and trials were documented.
